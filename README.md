Passionate Front-End Developer with over 1 year of experience in React.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, Styled Components, API consumption, React Query, and Git Flow. Knowledge of other JS technologies such as Vue and Svelte.

I am a highly motivated and enthusiastic individual with a strong passion for technology. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. I am also a highly effective communicator and team player.

In my current role, I was responsible for helping developing and maintaining a large-scale React.js application. I also worked closely with back-end developers to ensure that my work met the needs of the business.
